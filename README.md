# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where a FlatList component fails to render data even after a successful API call. The problem is related to how data is handled within the component's state and lifecycle.

## Problem

The `DataList` component fetches data from a public API.  While the fetch operation completes successfully, the FlatList remains empty. This is because the component's state update might not trigger a re-render, or the data might be improperly structured or accessed.

## Solution

The `DataListSolution.js` file provides a corrected implementation, addressing the issue by ensuring data is properly processed and the component re-renders after the state update.  We've made sure data structure is correct,and the update of state is performed in a manner that forces re-render. We also include error handling to gracefully manage API failures.
